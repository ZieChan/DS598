If you plan to not use Jupyter Notebooks or any other programming language, please see our [Github](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021). The following are some important links!\n\n- Competition Page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/\n\n- Online Visualizer: https://2021vis.lux-ai.org/\n\n- Specifications: https://www.lux-ai.org/specs-2021\n\n- Github: https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021\n\n- Bot API: https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021/tree/master/kits\n\nAnd if you haven't done so already, we **highly recommend** you join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/discussion. We post important announcements there such as changes to rules, events, and opportunities from our sponsors!\n\nNow let's get started!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWe assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python and programming. It's okay if you don't know the game specifications yet! Feel free to always refer back to https://www.lux-ai.org/specs-2021.\n\n## Basic Setup\n\nFirst thing to verify is that you have **Node.js v12 or above**. The engine for the competition runs on Node.js (for many good reasons including an awesome visualizer) and thus it is required. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You can then verify you have the appropriate version by running\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!node --version","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-05T22:30:40.911634Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-05T22:30:40.912794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-05T22:30:41.681051Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-05T22:30:40.912677Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-05T22:30:41.679839Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will also need Kaggle Environments","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install kaggle-environments -U","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-05T22:30:41.683029Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-05T22:30:41.683358Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.42413Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-05T22:30:41.683325Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.422753Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we have to import the `make` function from the `kaggle_environments` package","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_environments import make","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.426148Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.426505Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.564098Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.426449Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-05T22:30:51.563019Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The `make` function is used to create environments that can then run the game given agents.

Here are some!\n\n- Using the build city action to build new cities and thus build new units\n- Having cities perform research each turn to unlock new resources\n- Writing collision-free code that lets units move smoothly around and through each other when navigating to targets\n- Mining resources near your opponent's citytiles so they have less easy access to resources\n- Using carts to deliver resources from far away clusters of wood, coal, uranium to a city in need\n- Sending worker units over to the opponent's roads and pillaging them to slow down their agent\n- Optimizing over how much to mine out of forests before letting them regrow so you can build more cities and get sustainable fuel","metadata":{}}]}
